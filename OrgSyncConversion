<h4><b>CCNEO Holiday Party</b></h4>

<h5>January 9th, 2016</h5>

<p>The Cornell Club of Northeast Ohio holds an&nbsp;annual Holiday Party for alumni, current students and recent graduates. This year&#39;s event was held at the home of Jim Bennet, class of 65, and was a wonderful opportunity to meet with classmates during winter break and network with local alumni. Thanks to CCNEO for planning this great event!</p>

<p>The Thanksgiving Bus was a collaboration between the Cornell Club of Northeast Ohio and NEO@CU to provide low-cost transportation for students to come home to NEO for Thanksgiving Break. The bus&#39;s maiden voyage was incredibly successful, and we hope to continue to provide this great service to all NEO members!</p>

<h4><b>Alumni Charter Days Reception</b></h4>

<h5>April 2015</h5>

<p>To commemorate Cornell&#39;s 150th, the Cornell Club of Northeast Ohio presented two very special gifts to University Archivist Elaine Engst. These included 85 postcards that were sent to members of the Cleveland alumni association from 1908 to 1928 and a 100-year-old scrapbook compiled by a Cornell civil engineer and WWI veteran who spent his later life in Cleveland. These items will be added to the Kroch Library&#39;s Rare Manuscripts collection.</p>
