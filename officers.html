                                <p>I am currently a junior majoring in biological sciences and concentrating in molecular and cell biology. I do research in Dr. Andrew Grimson’s molecular biology lab and lead study groups for introductory science courses. On campus, I am involved in Cornell Anjali (an Indian classical dance troupe), Asha for Education (a non-profit organization), StethoSCOOP, and The Research Paper. Coming from Ashland, Ohio, I was excited to join NEO@CU and meet fellow Ohioans who understand that Midwestern way of life!  In my time at Cornell, I have really appreciated NEO@CU’s enthusiasm to form networks among current students and alumni at CCNEO. </p>

                                <p>I'm a Computer Science major originaly from Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. On campus, I'm involved in the student assembly's web development committee, Women in Computing at Cornell, and Paint it Ourselves. I first joined NEO@CU as Secretary, excited to meet Cornellians from Ohio and get involved with a club that supports them. Moving away from home freshman year was a big step for me, and meeting fellow Ohians through NEO@CU really helped me feel more at home at Cornell! As part of NEO@CU, I've meet and worked with many talented students and alumni, and hope to continue planning events and that benefit and bring together our members!</p>

                                <p>I'm a forth-year student studying Animal Science and Education from Cleveland. My studies focus on wildlife conservation, animal reproduction, and informal education. I work as a fitness monitor for Cornell Fitness Centers and a program assistant for the Multicultural Living Learning Unit. My interest in NEO@CU arose from being lost in a sea of New Yorkers who make fun of me when I says "pop". I admire NEO@CU's mission to enhance the academic and social experiences of current Cornell students, and act as a liaison between the alumni network, prospective students, and current students. </p>

I mentor and assist students from Parma with college planning, job applications, and scholarship searches.  As part of NEO@CU, I strive to bridge the link between new students and upperclassmen, as well as alumni.</p>

                                <p> As president and founding member of NEO@CU, I worked to build the club from the idea stage to implementation and finally to action. With a dedicated and talented E-Board, a supportive adviser, and our esteemed alumni club, leading NEO@CU was both fun and educational. What I love most about it is having a special NEO-Cornellian bond with students from home who, as a non-traditional student, I probably would not have met otherwise. I look forward to seeing how the club grows after I've graduated. I am originally from Warren, Ohio, but I now live in Medina.</p>

                                <p>I am originally from Parma and North Royalton. After many years at Kent State I forced myself to leave and find work, although hanging around Kent was hard to stop. I taught sixth grade in Grafton and then moved to Zambia where I learned about too many things to list. I now live in Spencer, New York with my wife, two boys, father-in-law and loads of animals both wild and domestic. Cornell has been a wonderful employer for my wife and I and has allowed me to pursue projects well beyond the normal.</p>
